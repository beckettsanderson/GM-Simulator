## GM Simulator

Managing a National Football League (NFL) team is the dream of many young athletes growing up. One of the most exciting aspects of managing a team is the ability to draft and cut players, which is one of the key responsibilities of a general manager. This General Manager Simulator creates a dashboard that allows anyone from a layperson to a seasoned football fan to create a football team of NFL players and attempt to optimize the success of their created team. 

Our goal for this project was to create a simulator for football fans who are looking to discover a new perspective on the game and/or understand what a general manager values when assembling a team. It also can help current general managers with managing their own team by looking at how their team will fare when they exchange players. It can be especially helpful when scouting free agents who have a full season in the NFL.
